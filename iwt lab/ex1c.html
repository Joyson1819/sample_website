National Engineering College<br><b><h1></p>
NEC, the most prominent landmark of Kovilpatti, has been the crowning glory of this Matchless City of Matches. Its celebrated ‘Son of the Soil’ Thiru.K.Ramasamy transformed the entire social and cultural scenario in and around this small town by establishing the excellent educational institution popularly referred as “NEC”. By wielding the magical wand of social commitment and munificence this foresighted philanthropist transformed a strip of barren land into a magnificent academic complex that has been consistently producing infallible engineers of high competence right from the day of its inception in 1984. This much-acclaimed temple of erudition was established under the self-financing scheme sanctioned by the Government of Tamilnadu G.O. No. 939 dated 20.07.1984 by the National Educational and Charitable Trust, Kovilpatti, Thoothukudi district
